De opdracht vraag het volgende:
**Study:**

- Hack response strategies.
- The concept of systems hardening.

**Exercise:**
A Company makes daily backups of their database. The database is automatically recovered when a failure happens using the most recent available backup. The recovery happens on a different physical machine than the original database, and the entire process takes about 15 minutes. What is the RPO of the database?
An automatic failover to a backup web server has been configured for a website. Because the backup has to be powered on first and has to pull the newest version of the website from GitHub, the process takes about 8 minutes. What is the RTO of the website?
